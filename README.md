##  Reuse of Open Metabolomics Data

Data sharing is a means to an end, and alone is insufficient: if shared data is incomplete, lacking in quality or missing crucial metadata, it is not valuable. Instead, data reuse is evidence of the value of open data. If a dataset is reused this demonstrates that its sharing was worthwhile and justifies the cost of hosting the data. However, measuring the reuse of data objectively is challenging. There are multiple ways a researcher may cite a given dataset - citing either the original paper the dataset was described in, a data descriptor (whose sole purpose is to describe the dataset) or the dataset itself. This research aimed to identify all examples of reuse of metabolomics data as of 15<sup>th</sup> February 2018, along with which repositories data are stored in and frequency of reuse per study.
